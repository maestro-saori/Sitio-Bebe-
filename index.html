<h2>Purpose of our Content</h2>
<p>As we finalize our content choice, we get to explore more videos in our list of categories to understand strategies for engaging viewers and driving donations. Gaming is the best content type for promoting fundraising as it offers real-time interaction, built-in donation features, and high engagement with a teenage audience. Our purpose as well is to raise funds for the residents in Sitio Bebe since they have have limited resources such as lack of clean water, lack of hygiene, limited access to healthcare and termination of businesses. Due to shortage of clean water and limited access to healthcare, there were various diseases that spread throughout the community such as hypertension, acute respiratory infection and acute lower respiratory tract infection. Our goal is to upload gaming videos and encourage our viewers to donate funds through chatbox to address the issues in Sitio Bebe. </p>
